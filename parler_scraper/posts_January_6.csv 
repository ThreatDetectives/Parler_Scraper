I have owned the domain StopTheSteal.org since 2016 After 4 Trump supporters were stabbed and 86 other Trump supporters were badly injured in violent attacks by leftists we became reactivated to work specifically to maintain the safety and Security of the millions of Americans coming to our nations capital January 5 and 6 - Ours is a pop-up minimalist peaceful protest. We use an aluminum ladder for a podium and carry a portable public address system. We have no funding for any kind of security for the event or the security and transportation of our speakers our organizers .We work in total coordination with StopTheSteal US as well as a coalition of others. Help if u can .
