More on Sheera. She wants you to superspread her crap article because she wants to become a famous propagandist. What a loser.

ANTIFA and BLM are racist terror groups. They worship violence and destruction and they welcome racists and fascists in their ranks. They’re filth and their parents are likely horrified that they spawned such degenerates and losers.

What’s with Walmart calling Senator Josh Hawley a “sore loser”? Is it appropriate for a major retail company to take a position on whether there is election fraud? Who is running this company’s social media and where is senior management on this?

"ANTIFA & BLM are racist terror groups. They attack in packs because they’re chumps, cowards, and gold medal winning wusses who cry to their mommies when they’re confronted by real men. I’ve seen them up close - they’re sorry looking losers whose families are embarrassed by them."

"""Graceful"" is not a word I associate with you, Romney.  You've been nasty SOB toward this president since the day you lied your way into the Senate by deceiving the voters of Utah.  You are desperate for a legacy, other than having lost an election for president you should have won, and you think this is the way to do it.  Trust me, for the rest of time, your name will be associated with big-time loser, and you will never be known as president -- unlike President Trump."

"People who participate in cancel culture are life losers. That’s why they try to “cancel” people. They do it because they can’t succeed in a meritocracy because they don’t have a single redeeming characteristic. Their sad, pathetic lives are only made whole by attacking others."

"The sad truth is many women lie for various reasons, like revenge, fame, money or child custody. The biggest losers of fake victims are real victims. If you #BelieveAllWomen, you're remarkably naive. Bieber has proof. Most men are not as fortunate."

"Most of the liberal lunatics clawing at their faces and calling for “violence” are class A wussbags of the highest order. When the “violence” they claim to want comes to their doors, they’ll be crying to the police for help. These people are chumps and losers."

"Evidently her employer didn’t want to have a person around who threatened to stab Trump supporters that disagreed with her. Now it’s no more talk of revolution for Claira, and all whimpering and wailing. What a pathetic loser!"

"‪Only the dregs of society loot. The people who loot are such losers and zeroes that it’s tough to fathom for sane people. And that they do it on camera, with zero sense of shame, speaks to a lack of dignity and morals that, thankfully, most of you will never comprehend. ‬"

"Very very well said. Across the world people are arrested for “intolerable” speech and very few are standing up for them. People arrested for calling a police horse “gay” or disagreeing with someone. “Hate speech” and “intolerant speech” is undefinable and impossible to address and frankly there is no need to address it. Intellectual hacks claim they are only intolerant to intolerance.... the best way to solve hate speech is not to become a fascist authoritarian state controlling what people may say, rather to expose people to more speech. Build immunity. Don’t take my rights away because some losers can’t take a joke, criticism or ignore a troll."
