"Funny how the American Bar Association, state bars, civil liberties groups, and, of course, the media, say nothing and do nothing about all the threats and intimidation efforts unleashed against law firms and individual lawyers representing the Trump campaign. I have never seen anything like this. Yet, not a word. Nothing. This is more shocking evidence of the Left's totalitarian mindset in action. And I am not aware of a single Republican official (current or former), including those blowhards on the Sunday's liberal talk shows such as Christie, Hogan, and Bolton, saying a thing about it. Truly pathetic."

This Michigan poll challenger just came forward with absolutely shocking claims of intimidation and harassment. Why aren't more people talking about this right now?

Don’t be intimidated by media outlets trying to make you feel like “you’re the only one who thinks this.” It’s simply not true (as millions think this). This narrative that “you’re the only one” is also their tactic to demoralize you. Don’t let it!Investigation is under way.

"Rather than an enemies' list, which the Left is putting together, perhaps we need a list of patriots, who even now speak out despite enormous media and other pressure to either praise the process and Biden, or confront other forms of  intimidation and censorship.  She's not alone but the list of patriots is too short to my liking.  Speak up and speak out!"
