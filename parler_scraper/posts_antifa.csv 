And it’s the same type of gun the hate America gun-grabbers in DC would love to BAN if they ever get the votes. Valued at $1,890! Someone has to win it ... might as well be you!

"The woman who was killed—who was she? Was she a Trumpster, or Antifa posing as a Trumpster? What threat did she pose? Why was she shot and killed, and by whom? So far there seems to be very little media reporting or even curiosity about these obvious and germane questions"







"Hearing from a solid source that DC police were being urged to ticket or arrest Trump supporters at yesterday’s rally for minor infractions, to advance the fairytale that Trump supporters are the violent ones, not the ANTIFA/BLM terrorists."



"The Washington Post, which celebrates Black Lives Matter, downplays Antifa, and dismisses threats against Josh Hawley, doesn’t like the way conservative hosts forcefully and unconditionally condemned the breach of the Capitol Building, cherry-picking comments and all the rest. Meanwhile, it and their ilk claim they support unity and peace.  They provoke and fuel frustration, anger, and hate. And it’s clear this morning that the media will continue to do so no matter what."







Instagram said this violated their community standards. It’s a video of ANTIFA and BLM harassing a Trump supporter in DC!



"WASHINGTON STATE: Man shoots at Antifa militia member, who is promptly rushed to the hospital. WATCH:"



"I don’t approve of storming the Capitol but isn’t it a fact that if Antifa and BLM did it, the media would be in raptures about the passionate demonstration of commitment to racial justice? #CapitolBuilding"









"With Antifa terrorizing Trump supporters last night in DC— including the elderly, women, and children— we needed police protection or the National Guard. We should be able to protest peacefully without fear of being physically harmed."



ANTIFA and BLM are racist terror groups. They worship violence and destruction and they welcome racists and fascists in their ranks. They’re filth and their parents are likely horrified that they spawned such degenerates and losers.



ANTIFA and BLM are violent domestic terrorist organizations.

"ANTIFA & BLM are racist terror groups. They attack in packs because they’re chumps, cowards, and gold medal winning wusses who cry to their mommies when they’re confronted by real men. I’ve seen them up close - they’re sorry looking losers whose families are embarrassed by them."





"ANTIFA and BLM are ultra-violent domestic terrorist organizations that exist solely to bring totalitarianism to the US. They worship violence and they advocate for racism and fascism. They’re living, breathing, human filth."



"The Proud Boys are absolutely demolishing the rabid ANTIFA terrorists in DC right now. Innocent women and children are being attacked in broad daylight by ANTIFA terrorists in the streets of DC. That being said, as far as I’m concerned, the Proud Boys are doing what the DC police should be doing to ANTIFA, but aren’t doing. PROTECTING INNOCENT CIVILIANS AND UPHOLDING LAW AND ORDER"
