One force pushing firms listed on the exchanges higher in 2021 is that shutdown policies have killed off small businesses whose earnings have been taken over by listed firms.

"“Paul’s proposal also would have rescinded the 18-year old Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), whose statutory interpretation has stretched to such farcical heights that virtually any kinetic action against a terrorist group is considered covered. That these provisions had to be introduced at all is a reflection of the absurdity of a war that, if the American people had anything to say about it, would have been over years ago. Unfortunately, the Senate killed the proposal by a 60-33 margin, preferring to keep this fruitless endeavor going.”"

"If 230 protections are eliminated free speech will be erased from the internet. 230 protects companies from liability and lawsuit. For good actors like Parler, this is essential to our existence. Without 230 the content moderators will have to work overtime to eliminate any and all potential liabilities on their platforms. Removing 230 will completely kill free speech online for good. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, etc already have moderator and staff and software to remove content they don’t like or that could be a liability. Respectfully Mr. President, if you are upset at Twitter, don’t shoot Parler in the head."
