A summary of how badly “experts” failed us on schooling during a pandemic. But the special interests are happy.... One excerpt among many in that video: Pelosi July “Going back to school represents the biggest risk for the spreading of the coronavirus” as she tries to shame Team Trump from even suggesting that kids be in school. Teachers’ unions loved getting that cover!

"New interactive map shows the risk of contracting coronavirus at events anywhere in the US | Daily Mail Online Fake, third-rate science: Do you think these so-called “scientists” know how to use their crayons left from their kindergarten days well enough to propose such a map? Just ask them: can we get a refund if you are proven wrong ? Bluff bluff bluff #climateguyWillie #globalwarming #climatechange #climate"

"We all try to do our part to protect freedom but no one does more, and risks more, than our troops. Let’s remember those who served with honor on this #VeteransDay Throwback to Veterans Day Parade in NYC last year"



"As I watched the two digital moguls testify before the Senate, my moviemaker mind was creating a plot for a horror film. At the risk of giving it away, here’s the gist:"

"My WSJ oped from September is becoming more relevant with the current success of Warp Speed. The most critical factor for a disease like Covid-19, with mortality so concentrated in the economically inactive part of the population, isn’t the overall vaccination rate or how many people demand the vaccine, but WHO demands it. Given that 85% of deaths have occurred in the 13% of the population above 65, the mortality rate will drop dramatically if high-risk groups such as seniors are vaccinated, even if the overall vaccination rate is low. The President targeting high risks groups first will mean that by Jan 20 most of the heavy lifting by the vaccine in terms of reducing mortality will be well underway and ideally close to done."

I have concerns that information from Kappy was not delivered to @realDonaldTrump & his effort to get it to President may have caused his death. I am aware that my life is now at great risk. But I put my faith in God. I prayed before I made the decision. I had to reveal TRUTH.

Freedom was granted to us by God. It is enshrined in our Constitution. But it is protected by the men and women who put their lives at risk in our military. This is the day to recognize and appreciate all of our veterans and say thank you for your service. God Bless you!

"In its latest Fund Manager survey, Bank of America warns that one of the biggest risks that could precipitate a global economic collapse is the prospect of mass “civil unrest.”"

"The typical pattern for new innovations is that “learning by doing” takes place in production thereby raising productivity by lowering the cost of production. This leads to goods becoming cheaper over time. The same is true for producing goods and services with lower COVID infection risk. Restaurants quickly figured out how to be safer than in February (electronic menus, enhanced delivery, etc). Banning certain industries to operate eliminates this innovation to take place."

"I'm OBJECTING to the fraudulent votes on the House floor! Thousands of sworn affidavits (at risk of JAIL TIME) were submitted confirming MASSIVE fraud. The evidence is clear. Today, I'm fighting to Save America! President Trump taught us how to fight and that’s the future of this party. Never give up. Republicans have to FIGHT BACK!

"What a sight! Hardworking cops who risk their lives and make $40 K a year, barely enough to support their families, being screamed and taunted by spoiled leftists who think they are morally superior and the cops are evil. With stoic restraint, they endure it. True heroes!"

"The price for speaking TRUTH can be high. Ultimately, one’s life & the lives of his or her family members & friends can be at risk or lost. I ask for your prayers that Almighty God cover me, my family members & close friends with Psalms 91 protection. @realDonaldTrump"

"Socialist propaganda media machine is running at full speed. Many lies being published - biggest is Biden won election. He did not. President Trump won in landslide election. Notice that censorship of truth is increasing rapidly. Plan is to soon allow you to hear only 1 voice & it will not be voice of truth. Be prepared, Patriots. We are living in perilous times. Our freedom is at risk."

"Adverse times can kneecap the toughest people (I know). If I’ve learned anything, it is to seek truth regardless of risk, especially from our Govt‘s bureaucracies (local, state, federal). We cannot give in or give up discovering what are clearly dishonest actions across America’s political landscape. #FightBack #HoldTheLine @TheDanBonginoShow @Marklevinshow @limbaugh @RoscoeBDavis @Tracybeanz @Ljflynn727 @TomFitton @SidneyPowell @molmccann"

"Heartless, arrogant, unelected CDC bureaucrats have decided that the lives of elderly Americans don’t count. For months, the CDC has been telling us that the elderly are the most vulnerable, yet they now recommend that 100 million so-called “essential workers” (healthy people working at everything from liquor stores to telephone companies) can get the vaccine before our grandparents or at-risk seniors can - people like my aunt who is imprisoned in her own home because of the danger that if she catches the disease she could die. This is immoral and bad health policy. I had planned to take the vaccine but will now stand in solidarity with our seniors by not doing so until they can. I urge my colleagues who are under 65 and healthy to join me."

"Everything we have learned over the past 4 years about Deep State crimes, including #Covid911, #FISAgate, the election steal and Epstein etc, is also all fully known by Trump. The mere thought that he would risk them getting away with any of it is ludicrous. He will strike eventually, precisely when he means to."
