Left never quits on ANYTHING. They make EVERYTHING a fight even when they know it will fail. Goal is to be a menace. Our side needs to use that tactic. Fight EVERYTHING the left tries. EVERYTHING.

"As anyone could have predicted. Didn't stop the left from frustrating Trump's objective of immigration reform. Suit was filed to be a menace and slow Pres Trump down. This was filed in Aug 2019, over 1 yr ago. Conservatives have to develop the mindset of doing this to liberal policy. Fight EVERYTHING. Do as they do unto us."

"One more thing, this “Trump’s America” menace to society has a Purple Heart from Iraq where an IED sent his Humvee soaring into the air. After it landed, he got out and had to fight for his life against jihadis. He won. Let’s all PRAY he’s “Trump’s America.”"

"Mrs Murray is the driving force behind Martyn’s Law, which is asking for mandatory vulnerability assessments and proportionate security mitigation at venues to boost safety. It is currently stalled by the coronavirus epidemic. “I am hopeful this is going to be launched soon and what the university is doing dovetails perfectly,” said Mrs Murray. “Terrorism is a modern-day menace we all have to live with. Up to the point where we were devastated as a family, I thought it only happened on the news and in films. I never thought we would become the news. Why did it take the bombing and murder of children at a concert to even contemplate new laws and more in depth risk assessments? The U.K. was on high alert at the time of the bombing I believe?"

The police state is upon us. Anybody receiving a city citation should demand a jury trial. Represent yourself. Subpoena alot of witnesses. A campaign of menace is effective. You have that right. Tie up the circuit court system. Overwhelm finite government resources. Then sue civilly for a violation of your right to freely move without unnecessary gov interference.

„The menace of communism in this country will remain a menace until the American people make themselves aware of the techniques of communism. No one who truly understands what it really is can be taken in by it. Yet the individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists. The American mind simply has not come to a realization of the evil which has been introduced into our midst. It rejects even the assumption that human creatures could espouse a philosophy which must ultimately destroy all that is good and decent.“ J. Edgar Hoover Source:

"(2/3) ...I will never support a party that enabled and funded terrorist governments of Iran, communist governments of Cuba and China or ignored malign activity undertaken by Russia. Lastly, I can never vote for a party, that has ""leaders"" who sat back and watched a virus unleashed on the globe, through lies and disinformation, by communist China...who watched their own constituents die, and refuse to hold China accountable. None of these activities are particularly uniting. President Trump has delivered on more conservative priorities than any other president since Reagan. But for some...the tweeting is just too much. I understand. Speaking of Reagan, he identified those who had grown tired of fighting the menace of the Soviet Union. Those people too, were crying about ""divisiveness."""
