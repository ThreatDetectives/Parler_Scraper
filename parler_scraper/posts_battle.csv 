ELECTION 2020: Projection: Valadao defeats Cox in tight Congressional battle

Now the New York Post is pressuring the president to concede before the courts rule. Gore spent 37 days litigating over a single state. There’s a case pending in the Supreme Court. Gore went there twice. What the hell is all this pressure 5 damn days after the election!  Screw these media outlets. They don’t decide the presidency. The Constitution does!  The president has an uphill battle but he has the absolute legal and constitutional right to pursue these avenues.

While the legal challenge is an uphill battle there are still serious legal issues pending. Giving up prematurely would be immoral & can impact all future elections. Subscribe to the Mark Levin Show podcast for free and listen to yesterday's show right now

"To give up the struggle now after so many months of hard fought battles, after taking 4 years of the worst slander the media could dish out, after absorbing one slimy congressional attack after another, is a betrayal of The President, the party, and above all the Constitution. #parler #trump2020 #usa #parler"

"Last year at Thanksgiving, I told my children I planned to semi-retire in 2020 to focus on Nicholas Sandmann cases & to write some books that were in my mind. 43 years of full-time legal battles seemed like enough. I was wrong. There was still more to do. For my family, my clients, my country, freedom & God. So I jumped back into the arena. I am fully engaged & determined to give it my best to protect the interests identified above. Any help you could give to my 501c4 foundation #FightBack to help defray expenses (security, investigators, admin staff, experts, etc.) would be appreciated. You can do so at www.FightBack.law. Thank you & God bless you. - Lin ❤️"

Communist propaganda sought to demonize @realDonaldTrump. Because CCP knew President Trump would expose Communists & rid our county of sympathizers. Trump knows Communism. He has been fighting it for 4 years to defeat it & cleanse our country of its evil. Will @realDonaldTrump succeed in his efforts to save our country from Communism? He will as long as We The People fight back to support him in his battle against Communism. We will fight along side of our President because Americans are born with spirit of freedom.
