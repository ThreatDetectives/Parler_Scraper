"People are reaching out to me to try to explain how we got to this point in our country, where everything now hangs in the balance.  If you have time, and interest, the best I can do on a large scale is to suggest you read REDISCOVERING AMERICANISM & The Tyranny of Progressivism.  I know it is not the easiest read, but if you take your time, and go through it page by page, it will all become very clear.  I am NOT hawking the book.  It is a few years old.  But I think it will help.  God bless!"

Let’s not forget— Life hangs in the balance of this election. Honored to speak about LIFE in front of our Supreme Court today to so many incredible patriots!

"The mass migration to Parler will hopefully result in conservatives becoming more organized without the threat of Twitter hate mobs and doxxing hanging over them. This will result in more successful real world activism, leaving leftists to bicker about it amongst themselves in their extremist echo chamber. It's important to stay active on here. If you've just signed up for an account, use it and keep using it."

"To the next generation of Republicans in Congress, remember where you came from. Remember to focus on home, on your loved-ones. And stay true to the principles that got you here. Thanks @RepKevinMcCarthy for inviting me to speak to the new members and for hanging out with me and Bryon!"

Scenes like this are what I miss the most. I’m so looking forward to live performances where we can all gather together again and experience the thrill of a live concert. I’m sure that many of you are missing these experiences as much as I am. I’m confident that I will be playing live concerts again in 2020. I encourage everyone to remain positive and hang in there. The reunion is coming soon!

Use this adversity to make yourself stronger. You can hang your lights on me my loves.

"So I’ve never shared this before but I have a crazy hobby. I grew up raising hogs and I lived next door to the livestock barn and I used to hang out there EVERYDAY and I still love those things. So I head to my barn sometimes and listen to the radio, try and think of jokes all while making miniature farms. Best hobby ever. Just finished this one. This is a few pics of a small cattle operation."

"My friend and researcher Heather Mac Donald nails it in this column. We have become a country of whimps, wusses and sheep. These so called COVOD experts think that we can conquer death. Only one person conquered death. His name is Jesus. He did so to give us life after death, not for us to hang onto this one at all costs. We will all die some-day and from some-thing. For perspective, 2.5 million people die EVERY year. No human “expert” can stop that. God decides when our time is up, not Tony Fauci or the CDC."

"Can we talk about this Texas case? It’s very interesting. I encourage everyone to read John Hinderaker’s post at PowerLine yesterday. But here is the most important takeaway: The state of Texas—and now 17 other states—argue that federal law and the U.S. Constitution require the Supreme Court to stop Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin from seating electors because their elections were completely unconstitutional. The 2020 election was a corrupt disaster and the fate of the American Republic hangs in the balance. #voterfraud #freedom #constitution #patriots"

I only speak raw truth. I told you so in my last 2 columns. Vegas has been overrun by low class thugs. Criminal element everywhere. Gorgeous billion resort hotels occupied by thugs w/pants hanging below asses. Why have we been invaded? Something is wrong.

"These three exit poll stats are surprising, but signal what could be good news for the president. Also, Trump leading in Florida at 9 pm EST is an encouraging sign for his campaign, especially given the panhandle is his territory and always comes in a little later given time zones. If he hangs on to NC, I predict he’ll maintain most of his 2016 path. NC can count mail in ballots for nine days after Election Day per a court ruling, but it is a state that started counting early — so there may be results sooner than anticipated there."

"Howdy y’all, and Sunday greetings from my hang out at Lake Highlands Shooting Center. Got some range time in with my Glock 42 .380, 100 rounds at 5-7 yards. I know, still pulling left, gotta work on trigger finger placement. Sad to say, but things may be getting a little spotty in America. The left now wants to classify white Christians as domestic terrorists, you can be certain Black, Hispanic, and Asian Christian conservatives are next. Charlatan marxists like Al Sharpton, Raphael Warnock or Jeremiah Wright are acceptable. Remember, an armed individual is a citizen, an unarmed one is a subject, and a target for Antifa and BLM...#JustSayin"
