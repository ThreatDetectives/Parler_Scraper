
ANTIFA rioters are attacking Trump supporters in the streets & destroying American businesses. Democrats REFUSE to hold these left-wing rioters accountable. I’m counting on YOU to help me stop the Left in their tracks. Chip in NOW to defend the Senate & help me hold these dangerous radicals accountable.

"Zuckerberg, dangerous anti-capitalist and autocrat"

"This body cam footage is CRAZY. God bless our police officers who put themselves in danger to protect us all every day. Democrats, stop demonizing these heroes."

Andrew Sullivan calls Republicans a “dangerous cult.” David Blight says we are a “new Confederacy.” This irresponsible rhetoric demonizes political opposition and lays the ground work for violence and civil strife

"Facebook must be broken up into a thousand pieces. The federal government helped create a dangerous propaganda and censorship machine by protecting it from libel challenge (hardly free market), and which collects personal data on its users and does with it as it pleases. It has also bought off the media and Democrats by using its power to support Democrats for public office."

This is a VERY dangerous time. Here’s why

"*FROM FOX LA: ""Just hours after L.A. County Supervisor voted to ban all outdoor dining last Tuesday, which she described as 'a most dangerous situation', we’ve learned that she dined outdoors at Il Forno Trattoria in Santa Monica.""*"

"POPULISM AND DISRUPTING THE TECHNOCRATS President Eisenhower said “…in holding scientific research in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.” This is the real substance of populism, which I see as a reaction to flawed governing by a small, unelected, and insulated ruling class. Listen to the full 6-minute audio at the link, where I cite the important examples of the Obamacare individual mandate and the opioid epidemic."

It’s a dangerous time. And media frauds have no credibility on this issue. They normalized political violence for years. Do not miss this show

We are moving into VERY dangerous territory. You must hear this



"Instead of protecting his son, with a serious addiction problem, he exploited him so he could have 5 palatial homes. He lives the lifestyle of a very rich Senator/VP/Elitist. Joe had him dealing with some of the most dangerous criminals and spies in the world. His addiction then became life consuming."

"We’ve now reached a point in our country where the Democrat Party will nominate & support, with the media’s backing, anti-Semites like Raphael Warnock for the U.S. Senate. In fact, Biden & Harris have campaigned for him& are headed back to Georgia to try & carry him to victory. No criticism. No pushback. Nothing. It’s truly shocking. And it’ll portends a dangerous immorality by a party that has a long history of hatred dating back before the Civil War."

"Had absolutely zero appetite for 3 days after chemo this week. I woke up today ravenous. I can’t stop eating. I had 2 Chic-Fil A chicken clubs, 2 large fries, a fruit cup, & 2 chocolate covered pineapples, & I’m still hungry. It’s dangerous to be around me right now. I could bite."

"Move over AOC, meet Nicole Malliotakis, a descendent of Cuban immigrants who experienced the dangers of communism and socialism up-close, who has started the Freedom Squad. Joining her are Carlos Gimenez, Maria Elvira-Salazar, and Victoria Spartz. We welcome the Freedom Squad to DC!"

"Liberal’s growing war on free speech, and their love affair with totalitarianism, is extremely dangerous. I don’t see any scenario where this ends well. They have no emergency brake on their behavior. They believe in “rights,” not Rights. That’s NEVER ended well."

"Wow. Andrew Yang wants private companies & governments to “scan a bar code” to force experimental vaccines, for a virus with a 99.7% survival rate. If you don’t have it, they want you to be denied goods & services. This is a dangerous dystopian future. StopMedicalDiscrimination.org"

Self-own—WaPo’s triumphant “fact-check”: it’s not true that ALL of the most dangerous US cities are governed by Dems; ONLY 19 of the top 20 are! OK then....

Can’t make this stuff up: Trump-loving CNN that represents the party of compassion for which cities were boarded up in case their candidate lost the election concludes #Parler may be dangerous because “platforms that allow unbridled free speech can become hubs of unbridled hate”

"Government action is nothing more than coercive force. Government is neither omniscient nor omnipotent. It’s neither innately good nor inherently evil. It’s just force—organized, collective, official force. Like fire, water, and oxygen, it’s necessary, but it has to be managed with care. It’s especially dangerous when we, as a society, start to respond to every problem by proposing a new government program. Government inevitably expands at the expense of individual liberty. When government authority is abused, we should therefore be reluctant to respond to it by giving government even more power. Doing so can resemble an attempt to extinguish a fire using gasoline."



But indoor dining is dangerous?

"Across our nation, radical liberals are attacking the police and calling for abolishing entire departments. This rhetoric is dangerous to everyone’s public safety. Let’s show our officers that we respect and appreciate them for their dedication to protecting all of us. ADD YOUR NAME to our petition to show that you #BackTheBlue >>"

The most dangerous woman in America calls for the complete dismantling of the political & economic systems of the USA. This hand-grenade in a headscarf should never have been allowed anywhere near power.

"Lord God, heavenly Father, you know that we are set in the midst of so many and great dangers, that by reason of the frailty of our nature we cannot always stand upright: Grant us such strength and protection, to support us in all danger, and carry us through all temptations; through your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen."

@dbongino shreads Twitter’s dangerous and abusive data mining practices. Their recent security breach is just one more reason why we all need to #Twexit

"This was murder, that lady was no danger to him. I feel totally deflated with what happened to America yesterday. This lady has paid the ultimate sacrifice I pray to god it’s not in vain"

Hunter Biden texts Joe Biden he creates a dangerous environment for a 15 year old kid. Hidin’ Biden does nothing to protect kid from his son. FBI has had this for months and apparently done nothing. It's now in hands of Delaware State police. Let's see what they do?

You are in real danger in Minnesota right now. Can you imagine a police department having to send this out? This is your future under Democrat rule.

"Heartless, arrogant, unelected CDC bureaucrats have decided that the lives of elderly Americans don’t count. For months, the CDC has been telling us that the elderly are the most vulnerable, yet they now recommend that 100 million so-called “essential workers” (healthy people working at everything from liquor stores to telephone companies) can get the vaccine before our grandparents or at-risk seniors can - people like my aunt who is imprisoned in her own home because of the danger that if she catches the disease she could die. This is immoral and bad health policy. I had planned to take the vaccine but will now stand in solidarity with our seniors by not doing so until they can. I urge my colleagues who are under 65 and healthy to join me."
