People arrested for calling a police horse “gay” or disagreeing with someone. “Hate speech” and “intolerant speech” is undefinable and impossible to address and frankly there is no need to address it. Intellectual hacks claim they are only intolerant to intolerance.... the best way to solve hate speech is not to become a fascist authoritarian state controlling what people may say, rather to expose people to more speech.
