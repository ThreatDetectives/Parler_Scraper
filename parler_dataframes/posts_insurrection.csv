"We attended the RNC on the South Lawn of the White House Thursday night. And when we departed the Democrat Party mob and rioters were violent crazed and organized. There were no peaceful protesters whatsoever. The police were trying to protect the attendees but they were outnumbered. We could also see and feel that this was deadly serious. The police pushed the perimeter out in every direction. The mob was not spontaneous or organic.

Twitter censored this tweet that was posted by President Trump today. Twitter said it’s now a violation of their terms of service for the President of the United States to say he doesn’t want ANTIFA to create an “autonomous zone” aka a COMMUNIST NO GO ZONE in Washington DC. Twitter is now a recruitment and propaganda tool for foreign and domestic terrorists to openly coordinate their global Marxist-Jihadist insurrections. Twitter needs to be absolutely OBLITERATED and President Trump needs to immediately leave Twitter and get on Parler. #twexit @parscale #STOPTHEBIAS,0,1,0,0
