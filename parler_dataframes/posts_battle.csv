ELECTION 2020: Projection: Valadao defeats Cox in tight Congressional battle,0,0,0,1
Now the New York Post is pressuring the president to concede before the courts rule. Gore spent 37 days litigating over a single state. There’s a case pending in the Supreme Court. Gore went there twice. What the hell is all this pressure 5 damn days after the election!  Screw these media outlets. They don’t decide the presidency. The Constitution does!  The president has an uphill battle but he has the absolute legal and constitutional right to pursue these avenues.,0,0,0,1

"Last year at Thanksgiving, I told my children I planned to semi-retire in 2020 to focus on Nicholas Sandmann cases & to write some books that were in my mind. 43 years of full-time legal battles seemed like enough. I was wrong. There was still more to do. For my family, my clients, my country, freedom & God. So I jumped back into the arena. I am fully engaged & determined to give it my best to protect the interests identified above. Any help you could give to my 501c4 foundation to help defray expenses (security investigators admin staff experts etc.) would be appreciated. You can do so at Thank you & God bless you."0,0,0,1

Trump should fight legal battles as long as he can: Rep. Steube,0,0,0,1
Communist propaganda sought to demonize @realDonaldTrump. Because CCP knew President Trump would expose Communists & rid our county of sympathizers. Trump knows Communism. He has been fighting it for 4 years to defeat it & cleanse our country of its evil. Will @realDonaldTrump succeed in his efforts to save our country from Communism? He will as long as We The People fight back to support him in his battle against Communism. We will fight along side of our President because Americans are born with spirit of freedom.0,1,0,0
