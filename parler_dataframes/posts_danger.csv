"Facebook must be broken up into a thousand pieces. The federal government helped create a dangerous propaganda and censorship machine by protecting it from libel challenge (hardly free market) and which collects personal data on its users and does with it as it pleases. It has also bought off the media and Democrats by using its power to support Democrats for public office.",0,0,1,0

"POPULISM AND DISRUPTING THE TECHNOCRATS President Eisenhower said “…in holding scientific research in respect as we should we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.” This is the real substance of populism which I see as a reaction to flawed governing by a small unelected and insulated ruling class. Listen to the full 6-minute audio at the link where I cite the important examples of the Obamacare individual mandate and the opioid epidemic.",0,0,0,1

"Instead of protecting his son with a serious addiction problem he exploited him so he could have 5 palatial homes. He lives the lifestyle of a very rich Senator/VP/Elitist.

"We’ve now reached a point in our country where the Democrat Party will nominate & support with the media’s backing anti-Semites like Raphael Warnock for the U.S. Senate. In fact Biden & Harris have campaigned for him & are headed back to Georgia to try & carry him to victory. No criticism. No pushback. Nothing. It’s truly shocking.

"Government action is nothing more than coercive force. Government is neither omniscient nor omnipotent. It’s neither innately good nor inherently evil. It’s just force—organized collective official force. Like fire water and oxygen it’s necessary but it has to be managed with care. It’s especially dangerous when we as a society start to respond to every problem by proposing a new government program. Government inevitably expands at the expense of individual liberty. When government authority is abused we should therefore be reluctant to respond to it by giving government even more power. Doing so can resemble an attempt to extinguish a fire using gasoline.",0,0,0,1

"Heartless arrogant unelected CDC bureaucrats have decided that the lives of elderly Americans don’t count. For months the CDC has been telling us that the elderly are the most vulnerable yet they now recommend that 100 million so-called “essential workers” (healthy people working at everything from liquor stores to telephone companies) can get the vaccine before our grandparents or at-risk seniors can - people like my aunt who is imprisoned in her own home because of the danger that if she catches the disease she could die. This is immoral and bad health policy. I had planned to take the vaccine but will now stand in solidarity with our seniors by not doing so until they can. I urge my colleagues who are under 65 and healthy to join me.",0,0,1,0
