"People are reaching out to me to try to explain how we got to this point in our country where everything now hangs in the balance.  If you have time and interest the best I can do on a large scale is to suggest you read REDISCOVERING AMERICANISM & The Tyranny of Progressivism.  I know it is not the easiest read but if you take your time and go through it page by page it will all become very clear.  I am NOT hawking the book.  It is a few years old.  But I think it will help.  God bless!",0,0,0,1

Scenes like this are what I miss the most. I’m so looking forward to live performances where we can all gather together again and experience the thrill of a live concert. I’m sure that many of you are missing these experiences as much as I am. I’m confident that I will be playing live concerts again in 2020. I encourage everyone to remain positive and hang in there. The reunion is coming soon!,0,0,0,1

"So I’ve never shared this before but I have a crazy hobby. I grew up raising hogs and I lived next door to the livestock barn and I used to hang out there EVERYDAY and I still love those things. So I head to my barn sometimes and listen to the radio try and think of jokes all while making miniature farms. Best hobby ever. Just finished this one. This is a few pics of a small cattle operation.",0,0,0,1
"My friend and researcher Heather Mac Donald nails it in this column. We have become a country of whimps wusses and sheep. These so called COVOD experts think that we can conquer death. Only one person conquered death. His name is Jesus. He did so to give us life after death not for us to hang onto this one at all costs. We will all die some-day and from some-thing. For perspective 2.5 million people die EVERY year. No human “expert” can stop that. God decides when our time is up not Tony Fauci or the CDC.",0,0,1,0

"Can we talk about this Texas case? It’s very interesting. I encourage everyone to read John Hinderaker’s post at PowerLine yesterday. But here is the most important takeaway: The state of Texas—and now 17 other states—argue that federal law and the U.S. Constitution require the Supreme Court to stop Pennsylvania Georgia Michigan and Wisconsin from seating electors because their elections were completely unconstitutional. The 2020 election was a corrupt disaster and the fate of the American Republic hangs in the balance. #voterfraud #freedom #constitution #patriots",0,1,0,0

"Howdy y’all and Sunday greetings from my hang out at Lake Highlands Shooting Center. Got some range time in with my Glock 42 .380 100 rounds at 5-7 yards. I know still pulling left gotta work on trigger finger placement. Sad to say but things may be getting a little spotty in America. The left now wants to classify white Christians as domestic terrorists you can be certain Black Hispanic and Asian Christian conservatives are next. Charlatan marxists like Al Sharpton Raphael Warnock or Jeremiah Wright are acceptable. Remember an armed individual is a citizen an unarmed one is a subject and a target for Antifa and BLM...#JustSayin",1,0,0,0
