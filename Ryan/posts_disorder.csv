If you look at these and find yourself wondering how I breathed I barely did. But I'm cured now and if I faithfully stay on my blood thinners these will never come back again."

An original no spin look at what's happening on the streets of Minneapolis with police on the defensive and some residents feeling left to fend for themselves. @ScottThuman WATCH: Law and disorder in Minneapolis

"Seattle City Councilwoman Lisa Herbold called the police (which she recently voted to defund) this month over a crime that she's in some ways trying to legalize. What's that old saying? If it weren't for double standards Democrats would have no standards. Some background: The suspect allegedly threw a rock at her window. The suspect was described as being ""unathletic"" and a ""bad runner"" which may suggest he's suffering from mental illness or drug addiction (this is Seattle after all). But like I mentioned earlier Herbold supports legislation that would drop charges against someone who can prove they suffer from addiction or a mental disorder. Author YAF speaker and founder of Politically Incorrect Institution Dr. Jake Jacobs joins me to discuss"

"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced new legislation that would create stricter laws against protesting and harsher penalties for protestors. The legislation called “The Combating Violence Disorder and Looting and Law Enforcement Protection Act” was unveiled Monday."

"Chaos in my home town of Luton as disorder breaks out with over 250 Muslims crammed into a mosque. Six police vehicles arrived at the Jalalabad Jame Masjid Mosque on Leagrave Road at around 2pm. Mobile phone footage shows chaotic scenes inside the Mosque with no social distancing in place and some people without masks. A council officer estimated that 250 to 300 people were present at the time of the disorder. A local said: ""Christmas is approaching fast is it okay to have large gatherings and parties? I understand there were Covid-19 regulations for places of worship but clearly this has been breached""!"

"America is going through an identity crisis. Many no longer look back at our history with a reverent eye but with a critical one questioning our history principles and values. Others feel a sense of constant confusion. Coming from Somalia a country steeped in its own disorder and unrest I am alarmed to see this happening in the United States."

"Being as dizzie Lizzie Dearden is such a big fan I thought I’d post this. For those of you interested swipe left to look at the proposed bill. The fact of the matter is that covert human intelligence sources (CHIS) have already committed crimes they still do. The question is about “proportionality” and whether the criminality is required. It definitely needs further enquiry I’m not comfortable about this at all. Giving people more power to authorise criminality sounds to me like giving paedophiles a pass to rape kids. Preventing “disorder” in the “interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom” sounds like a back door way of shutting down freedom of speech and assembly - demonstrations. For the national interest. See Lizzie we can agree on something."

"Remember the good days when we could go on vacation and enjoy living? When everyone with a pet could buy a ""Service Animal Vest"" for their pets. Well it's our turn to take back our faces. ""Health experts have said legitimate health problems can include ... people who have post-traumatic stress disorder severe anxiety or claustrophobia"". I have severe PTSD with everything wrong this year and with the mere incompetence form our Government. Anyone know where I can get a doctors note? #freetheface"

"Last week the House passed S. 785 the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act. This bill includes language to give the VA the authority to enter into partnerships with private entities to provide hyperbaric oxygen therapy to veterans and studies on the use of such therapy for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury."

This is an actual text to a parent from one of these liberal CCSD Vegas teachers. Liberalism is a mental disorder

"I can’t help but be struck by what is seemingly traits of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (or ODD) in the left’s behavior. The disorder is described in the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual (DSM-5) as “a disruptive impulse control and conduct disorder characterized by angry/irritable mood angry /defiant behavior and / or vindictiveness.” Hey does the description fit many on the left?? All disorders exist on a continuum so the degree to which someone experiences symptoms may vary. The disorder is erroneously credited to children and adolescents BUT —it certainly exists in adults. Unresolved childhood adversities account for a portion of the causes of the disorder. Incredibly interesting!!!"

I act like I’m okay but deep down I wish.... - Bill Clinton would get arrested - People would wake up to all the child trafficking - People would realize Trump is not the bad guy As someone who has battled mental health in the past I believe liberalism is a mental disorder.

It is a disgrace that the Senate will wait until after the State of the Union to acquit the President of these contrived phony Democrat charges. This whole pursuit of President Trump has become a mental illness for those consumed with it. Trump Derangement Syndrome should be included with manic-depression and borderline personality disorder and something should be prescribed for it. Any ideas?

"The Brexit we voted for is almost ours but expect a tumultuous summer expect more lockdowns like we are already seeing in Leicester expect more disorder on the streets of our cities expect a media propaganda onslaught the likes we have only seen in totalitarian communists states. Just as it should also be expected the Great British public will remain firm the solid silent majority which has and will continue to defy London-centric elitist expectations because there are more battles to fight before the war is won battles which on reflection the left have lost so far. Now is the time for us now is the time to take back control."

"New World Disorder! Come on SCOTUS save America!"

"‪Citing polls to support shutdowns is absurd. Asking 100 ppl if they support it 70 who still have jobs while 30 are desperately trying to feed their kids & save their homes is a recipe for civil disorder. Those 30 ppl have a lot more to lose & they don’t give a shit about polls‬."

"The state of our country explained in one picture. Even one gay guy here in West Hollywood--middle of the road Democrat--was telling me that white lesbians are ""just vicious"" and that most suffer from ""mental disorders"". (NO kidding !!! I think that is the understatement of the century !!! ) For the past 10 years I have SEEN bloodthirsty lesbians (mostly white/Middle Eastern/Asian) OPENLY talk about killing ALL Christians and Jews. #JihadJoe #HajiBiden #BeijingBiden #ChinaJoe #CreepyJoe #PedoJoe #genocidal #Obama #BLM #ANTIFA #Democrat #Democrats #Iran #Islamic #Islamist #rapists #pedos #TERROR #DemocratsAreGenocidal #DemocratsArePedophiles #WalkAway #AmericaFirst #AmericaWins2020 #Trump2020 #MAGA2020 #RedWave #VoteRed #DrainTheSwamp"

"In episode 39 of the Mikhaila Peterson podcast I spoke with Jennette McCurdy... who I now have a huge crush on. She’s an American actress song writer YouTuber producer writer podcaster. We spoke about her weird life growing up being a child star and insanely famous being stressed to death by that having a very complicated relationship with her mother to say the least dealing with a pretty severe eating disorder dealing with anxiety and her current podcast called Empty Inside. She also discussed her experience with (code MP for 15% off if you want to check it out). This episode was insanely fun. I don’t usually get along with people as well as I got along with her. She’s cool. audio link: linktr.ee/mikhailapeterson"
