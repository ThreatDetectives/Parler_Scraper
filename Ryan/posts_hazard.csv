"Google Street View of the AT&T building just a few feet north of where the RV was parked on 2nd Avenue. Note the 321W hazardous materials warning sign posted on the building. The sign indicates that materials in the building have some element of instability and flammability. We know that there were emergency back up generators on the property intended to kick in in the event of a loss of power each of these carrying a significant amount of fuel. Perhaps this is what the sign is referring to. Perhaps not. Could the materials housed in this building have contributed to the size of the explosion? #nashville #nashvilleexplosion #nashvillebombing #rv #hazmat #hazardousmaterials #att"

"#covid19 #climateguyWillie Now they tell us! World Health Organization experts have warned that even though the coronavirus pandemic has been very severe it is “not necessarily the big one” and that the world will have to learn to live with Covid-19. The “destiny” of the virus is to become endemic even as vaccines begin to be rolled out in the US and UK says Professor David Heymann the chair of the WHO’s strategic and technical advisory group for infectious hazards. “The world has hoped for herd immunity that somehow transmission would be decreased if enough persons were immune” he told the WHO’s final media briefing for 2020."

"Under President Donald J. Trump we have protected the environment as well if not better than any recent administration. Implementation of the Superfund program which celebrates its 40th Anniversary this year has led to the cleanup and removal of more than 400 of the nation's worst hazardous waste sites from the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL). In doing all these things EPA ensures that Americans of all walks of life can breathe clean air drink clean water and live work and play on land that is free of pollution."
