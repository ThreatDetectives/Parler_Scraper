"""Graceful"" is not a word I associate with you, Romney.  You've been nasty SOB toward this president since the day you lied your way into the Senate by deceiving the voters of Utah.  You are desperate for a legacy, other than having lost an election for president you should have won, and you think this is the way to do it.  Trust me, for the rest of time, your name will be associated with big-time loser, and you will never be known as president -- unlike President Trump."

"Evidently her employer didn’t want to have a person around who threatened to stab Trump supporters that disagreed with her. Now it’s no more talk of revolution for Claira, and all whimpering and wailing. What a pathetic loser!"

"‪Only the dregs of society loot. The people who loot are such losers and zeroes that it’s tough to fathom for sane people. And that they do it on camera, with zero sense of shame, speaks to a lack of dignity and morals that, thankfully, most of you will never comprehend. ‬"

Echo if you declare Biden the loser.

The same people that accuse us of being sore “losers” spent over $30 million dollars and two years investigating a fake Russian allegation. I think I’ll take my time and spend some of your money on this one.

So many patriots who are sending a message to BIG TECH! It’s the people who choose election winners and losers, NOT THE SILICON VALLEY MAFIA AND THEIR MARXIST-JIHADIST ACCOMPLICES who have decided to deplatform my campaign and interfere in a US election to silence me and my supporters.

"Very very well said. Across the world people are arrested for “intolerable” speech and very few are standing up for them. People arrested for calling a police horse “gay” or disagreeing with someone. “Hate speech” and “intolerant speech” is undefinable and impossible to address and frankly there is no need to address it. Intellectual hacks claim they are only intolerant to intolerance.... the best way to solve hate speech is not to become a fascist authoritarian state controlling what people may say, rather to expose people to more speech. Build immunity. Don’t take my rights away because some losers can’t take a joke, criticism or ignore a troll."

"If you get Ben and Jerry's -- just keep in mind, THIS is what you're funding. How this loser became a star of the left is stunning to me. Let's sell ice cream to fund efforts to disband and #DefundThePolice. Cmon man. #Kaepernick"
