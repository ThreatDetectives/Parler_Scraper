The next few months will be perilous. We MUST get back to foundational principles. Don’t miss my show today.

"Never forget our fallen...they are the true heroes Oh say can you see by the dawn’s early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket’s red glare the bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?"

"Socialist propaganda media machine is running at full speed. Many lies being published - biggest is Biden won election. He did not. President Trump won in landslide election. Notice that censorship of truth is increasing rapidly. Plan is to soon allow you to hear only 1 voice & it will not be voice of truth. Be prepared Patriots. We are living in perilous times. Our freedom is at risk."

"Echo if you LOVE OUR ANTHEM! O say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare the bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!!!!!"

Newsom's water plan previews a future Calif. that ignores history – at its peril

"In 1777 President George Washington is alleged to have had a vision of the spirit of #America warning him of three great perils that would befall the nation. The earliest recollection of this story is from a journal in 1861 and was allegedly recalled by a soldier #AnthonySherman in 1859. The story was never confirmed or denied by #GeorgeWashington but in these trying times for this live Q&A with Crossroads host @JoshJPhilipp  we'll revisit this story and answer questions from the audience. Join Us Live"

Word. @SidneyPowell is a patriot I measure all against. She is the textbook definition of what it means to be a friend of America. Go against her at your peril.

"Thank you to everyone who follows me. We have a big challenge ahead of us. I like history so your gonna see quotes that inspire me. Have a Great Thanksgiving everyone! It is not consistent with reason or justice that one set of men should make a sacrifice of propertydomestic ease & happiness encounter the rigid of the fieldthe perils & vicissitudes of war to obtain these blessings which every citizen will enjoy on common with them without some compensation — George Washington."

A student or faculty member can be penalized for not intervening when they see bias? This is fraught with legal peril. University suggests it may punish students for failing to intervene in ‘bias-motivated’ incidents | Just The News

"Twitter sucks. Twitter is totalitarian. Twitter is purging conservatives. The left is feeling its oats. We better wake up to the fact that all this outrage against Trump is not about Trump -- it's about conservatism. It's about anyone opposing the Stalinist leftist agenda. Until we wake up to what these people are up to we are in grave peril. The scary thing is that being ends-justifies-the-means zealots they don't even believe they're doing anything wrong. Anything to advance their agenda -- and advancing their agenda means eviscerating liberties. Don't think otherwise."

What a perfect representation of where we are today: a crow perilously pecking at a bald eagle who is taking it... for now.

"Veterans Day is special for me. My brother is a Navy veteran. My father was a Marine Corps pilot in World War II Korea and Vietnam. He was stationed on Okinawa preparing for the invasion of the Japanese homeland when the Japanese surrendered unconditionally. I was four months old at the time. .If we had not dropped those war-ending bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki I very probably would never have known my father. Today I honor his service and the surface of my brother to this great country. A country by the way in great peril once againI"

"Opinionby Josh Hammer This is a tremendously important presidential election. Trump must face reality: His political life is in grave peril and there is a real risk he might become a one-term president."

Opinionby Michael Walsh The next 3 months will be among the most perilous in US history. The past offers us some lessons. Call it the Tale of Three Republics. No wonder the Left has taken history out of the classrooms.

"“To conquer without peril we triumph without glory.” We know: Your victory will be glorious ! THANK YOU @GenFlynn"

"If the Democrats can get away with massive fraud by simply denying it then the US Republic is in grave peril. It means fraud is deemed acceptable and that is the mark of a banana republic.."

Am I the only one that finds it absolutely hilarious The Democrats are still trusting completely in the polls that they'll win? Are they not aware that it is the liberal media that pays for these polls? Are they not aware that pollsters are afraid to give their liberal employers polls with Trump winning? Are they not aware that polls are oversampling Democrats? Are they not aware the polls completely ignore Trump's surging numbers with black and Hispanic voters? Are they not aware that Trump can give an arena rally was one day's notice and pack the place? Polls are their Bible at their own peril.

"Parler is stumbling because the internet is no fun without celebrities to abuse journalists to torture and trannies to drive to suicide. Death threats are the currency of the social web. Ignore this truth at your peril."

As I was saying a few days ago...trust Boris at your peril.

"This is how stupid and lost we are across the West. ""Islam must accept that democracy comes before religion""...writes Denmark's largest newspaper. Who are they kidding? Sharia Law my friends will never ever shy away. It is the perils of our time...like a never-ending Clinton-Biden madness bottle that keeps giving...!"

"""To win this war we must first accept that we are at war that the enemy is real and homegrown and grasp why and how it’s being waged against us.  We must resist the temptation to believe that the full-blown tyranny described really can’t happen here.  We’ve received no pass no exemption.  We face the most perilous challenge ever to our liberties.  We must accept the reality of this fight and engage with steely resolve and vigor or perish as a free people."""

"Happy Monday! Begin your work week with a Prayer of Trust to Jesus: My Lord God I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know where it will end. Nor do I really know myself and the fact that I think that I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you. And I hope I have that desire in all I am doing. I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road though I may seem to be lost in the shadow of death. I will not fear for you are ever with me and you will never leave me to face my perils alone."

"Re: Oath Keepers open letter to President Trump. (ltr. attached) Dear President Trump We now face a moment of peril as great or greater as what General Washington and his men faced in 1776. The very survival of our nation as a free Constitutional Republic hangs in the balance. We have but one last chance to save it. The fate of unborn millions will now depend  on your conduct the conduct of the current members of our armed forces and the conduct of we the many millions of American veterans and patriots who are still loyal to our Constitution and stand with you. @Tracybeanz @DanScavino45 @Linwood @SidneyPowell @GenFlynn @mflynnJR @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump //"

"I'm surprised that #feminists aren't on board with the right to carry a firearm. If we really live in such a ""rape culture"" and women are in such peril on a daily basis why wouldn't you want women to pack? Why not have the right to the great equalizer? Doesn't add up to me. #Firearms #Feminism #SecondAmendment"
