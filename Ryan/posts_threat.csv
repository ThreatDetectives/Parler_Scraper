"TRUMP CARD is timelier than ever. It spells out the threat of “United States of Socialism” connecting all the dots and it shows how to overcome the long-term problems of Deep State corruption digital censorship & media monopoly TrumpCardTheMovie.com"

"Digital censorship is the greatest threat to free speech in America in more than a century and it could get even worse"

"The woman who was killed—who was she? Was she a Trumpster or Antifa posing as a Trumpster? What threat did she pose? Why was she shot and killed and by whom? So far there seems to be very little media reporting or even curiosity about these obvious and germane questions"

Echo/RT this if you are sick and tired of these fake Democrats calling for unity while sucker punching the defenseless and elderly. Notice how its somebody they know will not pose a threat? Scumbags.

"The Washington Post which celebrates Black Lives Matter downplays Antifa and dismisses threats against Josh Hawley doesn’t like the way conservative hosts forcefully and unconditionally condemned the breach of the Capitol Building cherry-picking comments and all the rest. Meanwhile it and their ilk claim they support unity and peace.  They provoke and fuel frustration anger and hate. And it’s clear this morning that the media will continue to do so no matter what."

"I’m not making a threat but rather simply saying a fact when I say that any Republican member of the House or Senate who refuses to object to election fraud next week is basically finished as a leader in the Republican Party. Time to start packing!"

"Funny how the American Bar Association state bars civil liberties groups and of course the media say nothing and do nothing about all the threats and intimidation efforts unleashed against law firms and individual lawyers representing the Trump campaign. I have never seen anything like this. Yet not a word. Nothing. This is more shocking evidence of the Left's totalitarian mindset in action. And I am not aware of a single Republican official (current or former) including those blowhards on the Sunday's liberal talk shows such as Christie Hogan and Bolton saying a thing about it. Truly pathetic."

"Tax fraud is the least of it. The Biden family has literally been taking money from the Chinese Communist regime. There is a national security threat here and it’s being covered up by the media #hunterbidenchina"

"If you cannot attack the message attack messenger. I have received death threats analyzed as likely real. Fine. I have protection of Psalm 91. @nytimes is now doing hit piece based on frivolous lawsuit filed by former office-sharing partners. Fine. I have protection of TRUTH. Guess Times is also upset with me because I am suing Times for Nicholas Sandmann. Just another day at the office."

"Don’t protest at someone’s home. In this day and age it amounts to an implicit threat against the family of the person you’re trying to influence. There are plenty of other ways to make your views known. Don’t threaten their families. And make no mistake—that’s exactly what you’re doing when you show up to protest at the place where they sleep.

@DineshDSouza and all of us American Patriots see the truth as to what is happening. Let’s not kid ourselves. We need to wake up and understand the true nature of the threats we face.

"Restaurants and hospitality has taken the largest hit and one wonders what this would have looked like without government mandates? The employment hit is obviously a mix of both private- and public sector responses. In March data suggests it was almost entirely due to private sector behavior. Restaurants and hotels were down 85% before the state mandates kicked in revealing the typically quicker response by the private sector to disease threats compared to governments. However starting in May the private sector started to become constrained by state governments and the share of the employment drop due to government policy started to increase. The longer we go the more the government is responsible for the lower employment levels."

I've been on @parler for three days now and its nice not to have any death threats or smut messages from Russian thot bots in my inbox. So that's a win.

"This is false and defamatory and made with reckless disregard for the truth. Even worse it’s just plain evil. I will get death threats over this. Thanks Keith. Thanks MSNBC. I hope you sleep well while my family suffers the consequences of your shameful rhetoric. What the hell is wrong with you?"

The whole world just watched an election get stolen in America. Yet the Democrats claim Trump is a threat to the Republic. They are always profoundly guilty of the sins they allege in others.

Efforts are now underway to suppress truth by threatening truth-givers with litigation. SmartMatic & Dominion are sending threats to @blocked & @EpochTimes. Here is the “threat” to Sidney from SmartMatic (software used in the election fraud).

Enough. Any GOPer going against Pres Trump's veto threat here is signaling they're following Pelosi and abandoning MAGA supporters. Time to let them suffer total electoral defeat and then we can rebuild it with PATRIOTS.

Someone needs to go back to 1789 and tell James Madison not to introduce the first amendment! It’s obviously a threat to our country. Thanks CNN contributor *** facepalm ****

"A MUST READ ABOUT THE DNI REPORT!!! In his letter Ratcliffe said that “it is clear to me that different groups of analysts who focus on election threats from different counties are using different terminology to communicate the same malign actions” and “similar actions by Russia and China are assessed and communicated to policymakers differently potentially leading to the false impress that Russia sought to influence the election but China did not.” “The analytic ombudsman says Ratcliffe wasn’t being political — he was being honest that China intelligence was being suppressed for political reasons” the senior intelligence official contended to the Washington Examiner."
