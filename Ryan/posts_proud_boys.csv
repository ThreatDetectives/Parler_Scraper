That being said as far as I’m concerned the Proud Boys are doing what the DC police should be doing to ANTIFA but aren’t doing. PROTECTING INNOCENT CIVILIANS AND UPHOLDING LAW AND ORDER"

DC METRO POLICE arrested Proud Boys Chairman @NobleLead as soon as he entered DC today. Here's the fundraiser for his legal defense. FREE ENRIQUE TARRIO!

EXTREMELY successful We The People/MAGA/STOP THE STEAL protest in Milwaukee today. Several thousand in attendance plus a large car parade. @TheProudBoys provided security. Very professionally I might add. 10 BLM showed. They wanted nothing to do with us or Proud Boys.

"Wauwatusa Wisconsin - Former Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke and The Proud Boys leading a Trump supporter rally right now outside MayfairMall - the day after a mass shooting. Chanting ""We Love Trump""' “USA” and “4 more years”"

Proud of my boys! Thank you @TheProudBoys for keeping patriots safe from ANTIFA terrorists on the streets of DC today! Really makes you wonder what the DC police have been doing all day. Did they get stand down orders? Or are they really this apathetic as Trump supporters and passerbys get attacked by Marxist terrorists ? How bizarre. @TheProudBoys

"Last night Proud Boys did what Proud Boys do. They kicked the shit out of deranged leftists who were attacking innocent people. Max and John are doing 4 years for tuning up antifa exactly the same way they were tuned up last night. God bless all of these men for fighting back. JusticeForLiberty.com"

Dial PROUD BOYS up to your next community meeting that might be overtaken by Black LICE Matter. Proud Boys don't blink when stared down by these CREEPS from BLM.

"Imagine being so full of hate that you when you hear that Proud Boys are collecting toys for kids for Christmas your first instinct is to stop it... How about you just try to collect more toys than we do? We'd be thrilled to find out that you collected 2 or 3 times as many toys as we did. How about you stop being awful on Christmas and we can work on the rest of the year later."

I love these guys. Proud Boys don't back down when the scum from Black LICE MATTER disrupts their events. Our side needs more fighters like this.

Contact local Proud Boys chapter. They are the only ones who will stand up to the scum bags from Antifa and Black LICE Matter.

Antifa comes to conservative bar armed with a knife. He gets surrounded. He stabs 4 Proud Boys. Media’s take: white nationalists surround black man. Can someone please let eelizalde@nypost.com know how wrong she is?

Antifa getting their arses handed to them by The Proud Boys in Washington D.C.

Proud Boys presence made it a safe event. They are the antidote to the disease of Black LICE Matter. THANK YOU PROUD BOYS!!!

"Proud Boys chanting ""Whose streets?! Our streets!"" after clearing the area of BLM/Antifa Marxists who have been bullying the elderly and families in Washington tonight."

Proud boys march from the supreme court following their face off with Antifa surrounded by cheering supporters thanking them for taking them on.

Proud Boys in DC today

The Proud Boys caught up with more Antifa and are giving them a taste of their own medicine.

"Enrique Tarrio chairman of the Proud Boys on why they are on the ground today in Washington DC to march with the Million Maga March."

There's been a Proud Boy at the White House for 4 years and everyone's shocked about the pic from today....

Proud Boys and Patriots showed up to support Mac's in Staten Island today.

Proud Boys have been warning you about the left for years.

"Proud boys face off with Antifa outside the supreme court in Washington D.C. chants of 'fuck Antifa' and 'back the blue' from the patriots"

The Proud Boys burn the captured BLM banner in Washington D.C. while chanting 'fuck Antifa'

"As the Left grows more obsessed over the Proud Boys (or as Joe Biden called them the Poor Boys) Glenn has founder @gavinmcinnes on to set the record straight: It's the ""POUR Boys...he was implying that we drink too much."" Gavin debunks the Left's ""insane"" fear mongering that the group is racist and out to cause violent riots and also discusses the Proud Boys' newest claim to fame: being impersonated by an Iranian disinformation campaign."

This is why Proud Boys show up to rallies.

"Chaos in DC: Antifa Attacking Trump Supporters With Fireworks Mace — 'Thousands' of Proud Boys Patrolling the Streets (VIDEOS)"

"Proud Boys pushing back against Antifa in Lansing Michigan."

And I am PROUD that Proud Boys burned that Marxist symbol too. BLM burns the US flag and the Thin Blue Line flag so PISS on 'em.

"Biden Supporter Plows Vehicle Through Trump Rally in Wauwatosa Proud Boys Administer Aid to the Injured"

Enrique Tarrio is a POLITICAL PRISONER!!! You don’t arrest people at the airport for “destruction of property” for simply burning a stupid BLM flag! The DC police targeted Enrique because he’s a Proud Boy and was supposed to be speaking on January 6th in DC. The arrest of Trump supporters will be a daily occurrence in Joe Biden’s America because the Democrats will feel emboldened to harass Conservatives. The justice department will let ANTIFA get away with murdering Trump supporters and Trump supporters will be arrested for simply practicing their First Amendment right.

"If you’re going to be in DC tomorrow be careful. The Feds are going to be pulling all types of undercover stunts to set Trump supporters up. Wouldn’t even be surprised if Muriel Bowser gives the DC police stand down orders so ANTIFA can assault and murder Trump supporters. Word has it that the Feds planted the magazines that they claimed were inside the suitcase of Proud Boy leader Enrique Tarrio so they could imprison him up to 8 years on felony weapons charges. They will make DC Charlottesville 2.0 tomorrow. The Dems and dirty Feds are wasting no time framing Trump supporters with felonies so they can claim as many political prisoners as possible under Dementia Joe and the Hoe."

The Proud Boys are raring to go in Washington D.C. #POYB

Proud Boys chairman @NobleLead left his protest and entered the BLM counter protest in Atlanta to protect another Trump supporter

"Wow this one’s a doozie. Proud Boys stop a murder and their black female friend gets stabbed in the process. Media takeaway: yet another example of Proud Boys getting preferential treatment by police. WHAT!?!?"

"Trigger Tommy was a Proud Boy who pulled out a knife while being attacked by a mob of antifa. He went to prison. A few weeks ago Proud Boys saw a man being stabbed. They intervened and were stabbed themselves. USA Today said it was “another example of PBs getting preferential treatment by police.” Last night four Proud Boys were stabbed by antifa and the headlines are “Four stabbed as Proud Boys descend on DC.” The media is the enemy."

Proud boys caught up with BLM/Antifa Marxists.
