Al Sharpton asserts no 'closure' on NASCAR's Bubba Wallace 'noose' fiasco despite FBI findings Perhaps someone used a time machine to nefariously leave the garage pull there in October 2019...knowing all the mayhem he would cause.

"Trump is a sweet kind and loving man someone you would want as a father. These disgusting monsters are insulting and abusing him while projecting onto him the crimes [they] committed to escape the noose. That is the only part about all this that makes me truly sad."

"Somebody educate the RACIST that BUBBA WALLACE is. Appropriate first name btw. If he sees someone walking down the street with this it is a dog leash NOT a ""noose""."

Netflix should make a movie out the Bubba Wallace NASCAR noose hoax. They can get Jussie Smollett to play Bubba Wallace. Smollett knows how to stage a race hoax.

"WELL PAL PERHAPS YOU OUGHTA BUCKLE UP . . WE CALL THIS PANIC IN DC. PATRIOTS ARE NOT GOING TO LET THIS GO. P.S. Probably your own team making the threats. #Georgia election official CHASTISES TRUMP. ""It's all gone too far. All of it!"" A tech has ""death threats and a noose. He was told he should be hung for treason."" The Secretary of State's wife is getting ""sexualized threats."" ""All of you who have not said a damn word are complicit!"" #stopthesteal #saveamerica #georgia"

"Yesterday MSNBC attacked me for debunking the Bubba Wallace fake ""noose"" story and then just one hour later NASCAR and the FBI confirmed what I had been reporting for DAYS. - the video is up on my YouTube channel. Look at these MORONS! hahaha"

HILARIOUS. Rope used to pull race car garage doors down is the source of the “noose”. Wallace is an example of hyper racial sensitivity. He jumped to racism right away. He’s been around those garages and he knew what that was but saw an opportunity for attention. He should apologize for smearing white folks. Wonder if NASCAR president will ban garage doors for life. What a crock of sh*t. And it took the FBI to figure this out? I originally said let NASCAR investigate.

"NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace reported seeing someone with a ""noose"" walking down the street. Immediately called it a despicable act of racism. Called the FBI. Turned out to be someone walking a dog. What a dope."

"I’ll believe the “noose incident” with Bubba Wallace when I see the actual noose or I don’t know SOME ACTUAL EVIDENCE. Until then story is bullsh#t... And NASCAR now caving to woke BlackLivesMatter mob. Again I have better things to do on Sundays."

Hope Bubba never drives past someone hanging clothes out to dry on a clothesline in their yard. He'll accuse them of racism saying the line could be considered a noose. Idiot. Loser on the track and off.

The NASCAR noose fiasco is a perfect allegory of the left in our nation... taking a perfectly normal mundane garage pulley & reporting it’s a noose... This is what the left does... They look at normal things SO HARD to try to find racism that they see something that isn’t there.

"Wow. So Bubba’s really gonna try the whole “it’s a noose because I say it is” defense Bold. Laughably insane and idiotic but bold."

"It’s almost like MSM reported the NASCAR noose without corroboration because they needed it to be true to substantiate their (false) narrative that everybody in America is racist... when in fact the vast vast vast majority of Americans are not."

"The FBI sent 30 agents to inspect a fake NASCAR noose but zero agents to investigate blatant voter fraud and a attempt to steal our Republic. As Trump says where the hell is the DOJ?"

"Has anyone seen/published a photo of the noose that was found in Bubba Wallace’s garage stall? Given there is an active FBI hate crime investigation over it do we know if a photo of the noose exists?"

"‪It was a hoax. ‬ ‪The FBI did an investigation on the “noose” found in Bubba Wallace’s NASCAR garage ‬ ‪& it was a door pull. ‬ ‪The sensationalized fairytale was another Jussie Smollett-like hoax. ‬ ‪#FakeNoose ‬"

"My guess is that this was planted by someone on Bubba’s crew for attention. He can’t get attention from winning races since he doesn’t win so they have to stage incidents. Every time we hear a noose incident it turns out to be a hoax. When they discover the hoax it quietly and quickly goes away. Jussie Smollett comes to mind."

‪Just a reminder that the FBI sent 15 agents to investigate an obvious “noose” hoax — yet that same FBI cant spare an agent to investigate the “noose” that hung Jeffery Epstein while on 24 hr suicide watch and solitary confinement.‬ ‪I guess NASCAR race crime hoaxes are far more *urgent* to investigate than the impossible custody death of the leader of a global pedophile ring‬ which implicated the most powerful politicians on earth. Good job FBI

"CNN and Maddow said Kavanaugh was part of a “gang rape gang” that Smollett was attacked in MAGA COUNTY and demanded FBI investigate a Bubba Wallace noose. Conservatives can let Trump’s legal strategy play out without losing any moral high ground."

"When Bubba Wallace leaned in to the fake noose story before the investigation was over and went on a media tour on The View etc. he became Jussie Smollett part 2... It's hard for me... and many others... to believe that this wasn't done simply to self-promote."

Burnt terrorist flag > Garage nooses > lockness monster > the tooth fairy > actual terrorists

Tim Constantine: “ICJ tightens economic noose around on Iran.” #WashTimesOpEd

"A noose which was actually a garage pull found in the garage assigned to #NASCAR driver #BubbaWallace at the Talladega Superspeedway had actually been there since October 2019 meaning Bubba was not the victim of a hate crime the FBI concluded Tuesday."

The noose tightens on businesses and workers as new lockdown mandates are issued.

Let's be clear. The DOJ invested more manpower in a fake noose then they did investigating massive voter fraud. They have been MIA throughout this entire process. So to say that they have not encountered any voter fraud which could change the election is doubly ironic because they didn't even look.

"Truly cannot believe I have to type this in 2020 but I have no other choice. I found this noose in my dressing room at BlazeTV studios. I am the only POC in the building. I demand immediate action be taken against this clear sign of systemic racism."

"Not just charges they have literally in front of millions of people with so much proof committed treason against the United States by interfering with federal elections yeah there’s some federal felony charges there but the one I want to see is both of them with nooses around their necks that is what they deserve for interfering with our elections!! the sooner we put fear back into everyone to be upstanding law biting citizens to faster we get our country back these two should be hung for treason. Nuff said"

"In Portland these kinds of anti-cop death threats are everywhere Several cops have been killed in these nationwide “protests” and hundreds of cops and Federal agents have been injured in Portland alone This includes at least 3 suffering permanent eye damage from lasers Where’s the outrage!?! (This is just a rhetorical question because WE ALL KNOW the answer it just makes me so mad ) Think about it! We had over a dozen FBI agents investigating the “noose” in Bubba Wallace’s garage even though anyone with a brain could clearly tell it was just a garage pull But this image gets no traction in the media"

"Some are claiming that the AP misquoted Barr on ending the voter fraud investigation and that he never said that. Huh. Well then where the hell is the investigation? Remember the fake NASCAR noose? That was front page news. I've seen no evidence the DOJ is investigating anything. And face it when it comes to investigating the deep state or Democrat malfeasance Barr has been missing in action from the start."
