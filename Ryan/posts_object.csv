However, the events that have transpired today have forced me to reconsider and I cannot now, in good conscience, object."" I now fully believe this was preplanned, the whole thing!"

"Jon Meacham's ""objective"" review of a Biden speech that he wrote gives me an idea. Here I pull a ""Dinesh Meacham"" and offer you an objective review of my own book."

@tedcruz explains his objection to election results



"Democrats have REPEATEDLY objected to certifying the electors for Republican Presidents — the last 3 times!  Did you hear from the political reprobates Romney or Sasse or Kinzinger that the Democrats were destroying the Republic?  Did you hear anything from the corrupt bastards in the media?  Meanwhile, the purposeful violations by Democrats of Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution, plus massive fraud perpetrated against the president, absolutely merit a showdown in Congress on January 6th!"

"AP discards any pretense of objectivity. AP writes: ""Demonstrations over President Donald Trump’s loss at the polls have resulted in charges against nearly two dozen people in Washington, including a person accused of setting off a commercial firework and four people accused in an assault that left the victim unconscious on the street.” Not really clear who committed violence against whom? AP purposefully obscures the fact that the thugs committing the violence are anti-Trump rioters. Read dailycaller for the truth."

Why should any Republican — in any race — ever agree to another debate moderated by journalists? This is not a profession known for political objectivity.

"They are propagandists. They don't pretend. There is no journalistic integrity. They don't aspire to it. It's not the objective. They are propagandists, and that's all they want to be. I've never been a fan of the New York Times, but actually having a free press that are not propagandists is good for this country. Too many institutions have been destroyed by the tyranny of the modern left."
